## My process

Once I had planned how I wanted to structure the HTML I then planned how to best use  CSS variables as if it were a large project. I used the variables in such a way that certain changes could be relfected instantly accross a whole site instantly without having to go back to individual components or classes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS variables.
